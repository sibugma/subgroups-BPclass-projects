# subgroups-BPclass-projects
As part of ongoing student projects, I decided to define a few projects that are relatively complex but align with areas I’m interested in pursuing in the future. Since I’m new to this field, I simplified the projects to ensure they are manageable for students and help them learn more in the process. The idea is to encourage students to explore and utilize various Python libraries while working on these projects.

I also welcomed some students who were interested but lacked foundational Python skills to join the group. These students assist with data collection and simpler coding tasks. Weekly sessions are held where each participant presents a report on the scripts or code they’ve written, sharing their progress with the group. These discussions allow us to explore better methods, evaluate alternative strategies, and optimize the solutions.

To better support the students, I divided them into three groups based on their abilities and personalities. The grouping was done using a designed questionnaire to assess their personality traits. This approach helps tailor support to each group in a way that aligns with their characteristics.
Defined Projects and Groups
Project 1: User Medical and Pharmaceutical Records Management System

    Group: Group 1 (Pink Group)

    Level: Simple

    Description: This project focuses on creating a system to store and manage users' medical and pharmaceutical records. The goal is to help students develop a basic understanding of database design and data management while working on a real-world problem. The tasks are kept straightforward to ensure that students in this group can easily grasp and implement the solution.

    Resources for Students:
        Articles and Resources:
            Hospital Management Using Python with Source Code: Discusses implementing a hospital management system using the Flask framework in Python.
            Patient Record Management System Project in Python: A Python-based project that focuses on building a patient record management system.
        GitHub Repositories:
            EHR-django: An Electronic Health Record system developed using Django that could serve as a reference for building similar systems.
            hospital-management-emr: An open-source hospital management system for reference.

Project 2: Disease Diagnosis System Based on Symptoms

    Group: Group 2 (Purple Group)

    Level: Intermediate

    Description: The aim of this project is to build a system that diagnoses diseases based on clinical symptoms provided by the user. For this level, students will focus only on clinical symptoms without delving into more complex models like image analysis or lab result interpretations. However, if the group shows interest and capability, the project can be extended to include advanced features like analyzing medical images or numerical test results.

    Resources for Students:
        Articles and Resources:
            Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning: This article explores how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict diseases based on symptoms.
            Disease-prediction-using-expert-systems: A GitHub repository containing an expert system for disease prediction based on symptoms.
        GitHub Repositories:
            Disease-Symptom-Prediction-Chatbot: A chatbot that predicts diseases using machine learning and natural language processing, ideal for understanding how to implement disease prediction systems.
            Medical-Diagnosis-Expert-System: A system developed using Python to diagnose diseases based on symptoms.

Project 3: Drug Prescription Recommendation System

    Group: Group 3 (Blue Group)

    Level: Intermediate to Advanced

    Description: This project involves developing a system that recommends medications based on the user’s medical history and previous prescriptions. The system aims to minimize side effects caused by drug interactions and coexisting conditions. Initially, the project will focus on simpler scenarios involving a few drugs. However, if students are interested, the scope can be expanded to include detailed analysis of drug interactions and patient history for more precise recommendations.

    Resources for Students:
        Articles and Resources:
            Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction Based on Clinical Data: Discusses predicting drug interactions based on clinical data, helping to develop a drug recommendation system.
            A Review of Drug Recommender Systems with Machine Learning Approaches: Reviews drug recommender systems using machine learning, valuable for building advanced recommendation systems.
        GitHub Repositories:
            Drug-Interaction-Checker: A Python-based system for checking drug interactions, a useful reference for building drug recommendation systems.
            Medication-Recommendation-System: A recommendation system that uses machine learning to suggest medications based on user data.

Common Focus Across Projects

For Projects 2 and 3, efforts will be made to concentrate on a fixed set of diseases to create a more comprehensive and unified system. This alignment ensures that the projects complement each other and contribute to building a more integrated solution.

This collaborative and iterative process not only fosters a deeper understanding of Python programming and related tools but also encourages teamwork and problem-solving skills.
